The last time George V. Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election as Ohio's Governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his most optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics.
This year, Mr. Voinovich, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third consecutive term, is running again, this time for the Senate seat held by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring.
That has not prevented Mr. Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary O. Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign.
Ms. Boyle, a former commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing the nation's seventh most populous state in what she describes as a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring, has nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats -- President Clinton foremost among them -- on the campaign trail.
Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard on the issue of education, seeking to portray Mr. Voinovich, 62, as a lackluster steward who allowed the state's schools to decline.
